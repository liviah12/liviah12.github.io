This repo is for ATLS 2200. I created it as part of our first assignment.
Few fun facts:
I am 20 years old and don't have my lisence (I can drive I promise it just scares me!)
I came into CU Boulder as a theater major and within like 3 weeks called my parents crying and picked CSCI randomly as a major (and I really like it, yay!)
I love fall and winter
