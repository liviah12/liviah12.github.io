        <p>A <strong>pitaya</strong> (/pɪˈtaɪ.ə/) or <strong>pitahaya</strong> (/ˌpɪtəˈhaɪ.ə/) is the fruit of several different cactus species indigenous to the region of southern Mexico and along the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.[1][2] Pitaya is cultivated in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the United States, the Caribbean, Australia, and throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world.</p>

        <p><em>Pitaya</em> usually refers to fruit of the genus <em>Stenocereus</em>, while <em>pitahaya</em> or <strong>dragon fruit</strong> refers to fruit of the genus <em>Selenicereus</em> (formerly <em>Hylocereus</em>), both in the family Cactaceae.[3] The common name in English – dragon fruit – derives from the leather-like skin and scaly spikes on the fruit exterior. Depending on the variety, pitaya fruits may have sweet- or sour-tasting flesh that can be red, white, or yellow in color.</p>
    
    <h2 id="Vernacular">Vernacular names</h2>
        <p>These fruits are commonly known in English as "dragon fruit", a name used since 1963, apparently resulting from the leather-like skin and prominent scaly spikes on the fruit exterior.[4] The fruit is often designated as "Vietnamese dragon fruit" as Vietnam is the lead exporter.[5] The fruit may also be known as a <strong>strawberry pear</strong>.[2][6] </p>

        <p>The names <em>pitahaya</em> and <em>pitaya</em> derive from Mexico, and pitaya roja in Central America and northern South America, possibly relating to pitahaya for names of tall cacti species with flowering fruit.[2][7]</p>

        <p>Pitaya or dragon fruit is native to the region of southern Mexico and along the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.[1][2] The dragon fruit is cultivated in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the United States, the Caribbean, Australia, and throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world.[1][2]</p>

        <h3 id="Stenocereus"><em>Stenocereus</em></h3>
            <p><em>Stenocereus</em> fruit (sour pitayas) are a variety that is commonly eaten in the arid regions of the Americas. They are more sour and refreshing, with juicier flesh and a stronger taste.</p>

            <p>The sour pitaya or <em>pitaya agria</em> (<em>S. gummosus</em>) in the Sonoran Desert has been an important food source for indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Seri people of northwestern Mexico still harvest the fruit, and call the plant <em>ziix is ccapxl</em> "thing whose fruit is sour".</p>
                
            <p>The fruit of related species, such as <em>S. queretaroensis</em> and the dagger cactus or <em>pitaya de mayo</em> (<em>S. griseus</em>),[3]: 223–225  are also locally important foods. The fruit of the organ pipe cactus (<em>S. thurberi</em>, called <em>ool</em> by the Seris) is the <em>pitaya dulce</em> "sweet pitaya".</p>

        <h3 id="Dragonfruit">Dragon fruit, <em>Selenicereus</em></h3>
            <p>Sweet pitayas come in three types, all with leathery, slightly leafy skin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Selenicereus undatus</em> (<em>Pitaya blanca</em> or white-fleshed pitaya, also known as <em>Hylocereus undatus</em>) has pink-skinned fruit with white flesh. This is the most commonly seen "dragon fruit".</li>
                <li><em>Selenicereus costaricensis</em> (<em>Pitaya roja</em> or red-fleshed pitaya, also known as <em>Hylocereus costaricensis</em>, and possibly incorrectly as <em>Hylocereus polyrhizus</em>) has red-skinned fruit with red flesh.</li>
                <li><em>Selenicereus megalanthus</em> (<em>Pitaya amarilla</em> or yellow pitaya, also known as <em>Hylocereus megalanthus</em>) has yellow-skinned fruit with white flesh.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The fruit normally weighs from 150 to 600 grams (5+1⁄2 to 21 oz); some may reach 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz).[8] Early imports from Colombia to Australia were designated "<em>Hylocereus ocampensis</em>" (or "<em>Cereus repandus</em>", the red fruit) and "Cereus triangularis" (supposedly, the yellow fruit).</p>
